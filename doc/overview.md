YADAMU can also copy data directly between any of the supported databases. When copying between databases a confguration file is used to specify the source and target for the copy operation. This prevents the command line from becoming overly complex.

The following shows a simple configuration file that can be used to copy the contents of the Northwind database from SQL Server into MySQL. The file defines two named connections, "sourceDB" and "targetDB". It also defines two named schemas, "sourceSchema" and "targetSchema". It then defines a single job that performs the copy. The JOB consists of a source and a target, which are defined in terms of the named connections and schemas.

  "connections"                       : {

YADAMU includes a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to peform YADAMU operations without mastering the command line interface. The GUI can also be used to create and edit YADAMU configuration files. You can learn more about YADAMU's GUI [here](https://github.com/markddrake/YADAMU---Yet-Another-DAta-Migration-Utility/blob/master/src/README.md).

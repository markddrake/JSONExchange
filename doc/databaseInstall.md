# Database Support Packages

YADAMU's database interfaces are tightly integrated with the target database. In order to optimize performance certain dictionary centric operations are run on the database server itself. This functionality is encapsulated as a set of packages or procedures that must be installed in the database before using YADAMU.

Database scripts are located in the folder src/install and organized by database

Installion Instructions for each supported database are given below:

[Oracle](oracleInstallation.md)

[SQL Server](sqlserverInstallation.md)

[Postgres](postgresInstallation.md)

[MySQL](postgresInstallation.md)

[MaraiDB](postgresInstallation.md)
